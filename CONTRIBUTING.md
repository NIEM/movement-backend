## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a NIEM open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

## How to Contribute

This project constitutes a collaborative work. Government employees and members of the public are encouraged to improve the project by contributing. 

To make a contribution to this repository, visit the [README](README.md) where you will find more detailed technical information.

In the spirit of open-source tooling, we have provided a [Scrum board](https://github.com/NIEM/Movement/projects/1) that allows users to keep track of Movement’s issues and enhancements. Anyone can [submit a new issue](https://github.com/NIEM/Movement/issues) for the tool for something they would like to see added or a bug. Once reviewed by the engineering team, issues will be added to the Scrum board's backlog. Developers and tool contributors can then address issues from the backlog and track their status using the Scrum board—providing an Agile approach to development and complete transparency to users.
